    abstract = "{Detection of protein homology via sequence similarity has important applications in biology, from protein structure and function prediction to reconstruction of phylogenies. Although current methods for aligning protein sequences are powerful, challenges remain, including problems with homologous overextension of alignments and with regions under convergent evolution. Here, we test the ability of the profile hidden Markov model method HMMER3 to correctly assign homologous sequences to \\&gt;13 000 manually curated families from the Pfam database. We identify problem families using protein regions that match two or more Pfam families not currently annotated as related in Pfam. We find that HMMER3 E-value estimates seem to be less accurate for families that feature periodic patterns of compositional bias, such as the ones typically observed in coiled-coils. These results support the continued use of manually curated inclusion thresholds in the Pfam database, especially on the subset of families that have been identified as problematic in experiments such as these. They also highlight the need for developing new methods that can correct for this particular type of compositional bias.}",

The MCScanX toolkit implements an adjusted MCScan algorithm for detection of synteny and collinearity that extends the original software by incorporating 14 utility programs for visualization of results and additional downstream analyses. Applications of MCScanX to several sequenced plant genomes and gene families are shown as examples. MCScanX can be used to effectively analyze chromosome structural changes, and reveal the history of gene family expansions that might contribute to the adaptation of lineages and taxa. An integrated view of various modes of gene duplication can supplement the traditional gene tree analysis in specific families.

	abstract = {The increasingly widespread availability of genomic data has created a growing need for fast, sensitive and scalable comparative analysis methods. A key aspect of comparative genomic analysis is the study of synteny, co-localized gene clusters shared among genomes due to descent from common ancestors. Synteny can provide unique insight into the origin, function, and evolution of genome architectures, but methods to identify syntenic patterns in genomic datasets are often inflexible and slow, and use diverse definitions of what counts as likely synteny. Moreover, the reliable identification of putatively syntenic regions (i.e., whether they are truly indicative of homology) with different lengths and signal to noise ratios can be difficult to quantify. Here, we present Mology, a fast, flexible, alignment-free, nonparametric method to detect regions of syntenic elements among genomes or other datasets. The core algorithm operates on consecutive, rank-ordered elements, which could be genes, operons, motifs, sequence fragments, or any other orderable element. It is agnostic to the physical distance between distinct elements and also to directionality and order within syntenic regions, although such considerations can be addressed post hoc. We describe the underlying statistical theory behind our analysis method, and employ a Monte Carlo approach to estimate the false positive rate and positive predictive values for putative syntenic regions. We also evaluate how varying amounts of noise affect recovery of true syntenic regions among Saccharomycetaceae yeast genomes with up to 100 million years of divergence. We discuss different strategies for recursive application of our method on syntenic regions with sparser signal than considered here, as well as the general applicability of the core algorithm.Competing Interest StatementThe authors have declared no competing interest.},

Nonetheless, leveraging information across multiple genomes remains a significant challenge in nearly all eukaryotic systems. These challenges range from studying the evolution of chromosome structure, to finding candidate genes for quantitative trait loci, to testing hypotheses about speciation and adaptation. Here, we present GENESPACE, which addresses these challenges by integrating conserved gene order and orthology to define the expected physical position of all genes across multiple genomes. We demonstrate this utility by dissecting presence–absence, copy-number, and structural variation at three levels of biological organization: spanning 300 million years of vertebrate sex chromosome evolution, across the diversity of the Poaceae (grass) plant family, and among 26 maize cultivars. The methods to build and visualize syntenic orthology in the GENESPACE R package offer a significant addition to existing gene family and synteny programs, especially in polyploid, outbred, and other complex genomes.},
